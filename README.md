give enriches a git repo by enriching its commits.
A git repo is composed of commits. However, the information of a commit is limited, so we are planning to enrich a commit by adding information from Issues and PRs from github. Issues and PRs record how contributes worked together for commits in a repo which can give us a lively picture of how a repo is contructed.
